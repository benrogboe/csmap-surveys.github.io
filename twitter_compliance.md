### Thank you for enrolling in a study by researchers at the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University. Your participation is helping us to learn more about how people use Twitter in the United States. You can learn more about our research here: <a href="https://csmapnyu.org">csmapnyu.org</a>.

By being part of this study, you will see a timeline of fact-checking organizations have been added to your Twitter account.

# How we added a new list to your feed
When you signed up for this study and took our survey, you authenticated your Twitter account. Doing so allowed us to programmatically add a list of fact-checking organizations to your account. This is the only intervention we will make for this experiment. 

You can access this fact-checking in the top header of your Twitter feed (see below).

# You need to visit the fact-checking Twitter timeline regularly for a month.

Over the course of the study, you can submit up to 10 screenshots for the maximum rewards.

1. Scroll through the Tweets on the Fact-checking feed and see if you find anything interesting.

2. Each day, you will receive a link to a survey asking you to submit a link or a screenshot of a Tweet that you found interesting on the fact-checking timeline. (For instructions on how to create a screenshot on your current device, visit <a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/</a>.)

3. You will also be asked to type a 1-2 sentence response about why you found the Tweet interesting.
