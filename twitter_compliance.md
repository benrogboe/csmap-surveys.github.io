## Thank you for enrolling in a study by researchers at the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University. 

Your participation is helping us to learn more about how people use Twitter in the United States. You can learn more about our research here: <a href="https://csmapnyu.org">csmapnyu.org</a>.

**By being part of this study, you will see a timeline of fact-checking organizations have been added to your Twitter account.**

### How we added a new list to your feed
When you signed up for this study and took our survey, you authenticated your Twitter account. Doing so allowed us to programmatically add a list of fact-checking organizations to your account. This is the only intervention we will make for this experiment. 

You can access this fact-checking in the top header of your Twitter feed (see below).


 <p align="center"><img src="images/twitter_list.png" style="padding:15px;" alt="Twitter interface with Factchecking list highlighted" style="max-width:600px;border:1px solid #ccc; margin-top:50px;"></p>


### You need to visit the fact-checking Twitter timeline regularly for a month.

Over the course of the study, you can submit up to 10 screenshots for the maximum rewards.

1. Scroll through the Tweets on the Fact-checking feed and see if you find anything interesting.

2. Each day, you will receive a link to a survey asking you to submit a link or a screenshot of a Tweet that you found interesting on the fact-checking timeline. (For instructions on how to create a screenshot on your current device, visit <a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/</a>.) 
3. You will also be asked to type a 1-2 sentence response about why you found the Tweet interesting.


#### Example 1: Screen capture of Tweet

<p align="center"><img src="images/twitter_screenshot_example.png" alt="screenshot of a Tweet where the author, tweet and likes and retweets options are included" width="400"></p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Example of a Tweet screenshot, this is all the info that needs to be included in the screenshot (To respect your privacy, we ask you not screen capture your entire desktop or Twitter interface.)</p>

#### Example 2: Copying link to Tweet

### Rewards can be earned as follows:
At the end of the four weeks, we will invite you to complete a 10-minute questionnaire. If you follow the study rules: submit Twitter screenshots or links through survey links you receive via email, and answer the final questionnaire, you will receive a gift card. 

The amount of the gift card depends on how many of the following tasks you are able to complete: 
- Initial survey: $2
- Screenshots/links:
  - At least 10 screenshots/links: $18 or
  - Between 5 and 10 screenshots/links: $13 or
  - Less than 5 screenshots: no additional compensation
- Final survey: $5

As an active participant, you can earn up to $25 (by completing both surveys and submitting at least 10 Twitter screenshots or links). You will only be compensated for the amount of tasks you complete successfully.


### When will I see my rewards?
This study continues through TK. We will screen submissions for completeness and distribute rewards by TK.
