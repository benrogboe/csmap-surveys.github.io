	<h2 id="html">What does the toggle next to "Share YouTube Page Content" do?</h2>
	The toggle next to "Share YouTube Page Content" allows URL Historian to collect videos listed when visiting youtube.com. Sharing this data is optional and not required.

<div class="extrapadding">
	<h2 id="pause">What options are available if there are times I don’t want to share data?</h2>

		<li>By Date allows you to delete data for the days you select.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you delete data within the extension, it is effective immediately and will remove selected records from our server.</p>
	<p>If more than ten days have passed since data was collected, you can contact NYU CSMaP Engineers at <a href="mailto:csmapsupport@nyu.edu">csmapsupport@nyu.edu</a> to request your data be deleted. Please include the dates or times of collection you need deleted.</p>
