		<li>From the extensions menu, you will see URL Historian listed. Select the three dots next to the extension name to reveal a submenu. The submenu provides the option “Remove from Chrome…”  to uninstall the extension.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="html">What does the toggle next to "Share YouTube Page Content" do?</h2>
	The toggle next to "Share YouTube Page Content" allows URL Historian to collect the data about the YouTube videos you watch when visiting youtube.com. Sharing this data is optional and not required.
</div>

<div class="extrapadding">
	<h2 id="pause">What options are available if there are times I don’t want to share data?</h2>
	<p>The toggle next to "Pause" on the left side of the extension window allows you to pause and resume data collection at any time.

	<ol>
		<li>Slide the toggle button to the left to pause data collection, and to the right to resume data collection.</li>
		<li>After the extension is paused for 60 minutes, a popup window will appear reminding you to resume activity. After the first reminder, follow-up reminders will appear every four hours.</li>

	</ul>
	<p>When you delete data within the extension, it is effective immediately and will remove selected records from our server.</p>
	<p>If more than ten days have passed since data was collected, you can contact NYU CSMaP Engineers at <a href="mailto:csmapsupport@nyu.edu">csmapsupport@nyu.edu</a> to request your data be deleted. Please include the dates or times of collection you need deleted.</p>
