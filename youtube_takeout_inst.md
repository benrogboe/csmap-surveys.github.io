## Step 2: Wait for your takeout data to become available
After completing the Goolge takeout request, it should only be a few minutes before you receive the archive from Google in your inbox. On some rare occasions it can take a few days.

## Step 3: Submit your takeout data to receive points
When the archive is ready, you will receive an email from “Google Takeout” with the subject “Your Google data is ready to download.”

After you download the takeout data to your computer, you are ready to upload it to the study. **You can upload the file that ends in ".zip" to the personalized link provided to you in the email after you completed your survey.**


Please email csmapsupport@nyu.edu with the subject line "YouTube takeout" if you have any issues with these steps.
