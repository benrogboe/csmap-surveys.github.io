# Instructions for contributing YouTube Data

**Step 1: Request YouTube data from Google Takeout services**

1. Visit this link: https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/youtube 
2. Configure the included data settings to be limited to: history, my-comments, my-posts, playlists, and subscriptions.
3. Click on “Next Step”
4. For the file format field, select “.zip”
5. For file size, select 1 GB. 
*Note: if your file size is larger than 1 GB, you most likely selected more data than requested. Please make sure you unselect “videos” in the configuration settings.*
6. For more details and screen captures of these steps.

**Step 2: Wait for your takeout data to become available**
After completing these steps, it may take Google anywhere from 1 hour to a few days to send you the data archive.


**Step 3: Submit your takeout data to receive points**
When the archive is ready, you will see an email from “Google Takeout” with the subject “Your Google Data is ready to download.”

After you download your takeout data, you are ready to upload your data to the study <a href="https://www.csmapsurveys.org/youtube_takeout.html">upload form</a>.
You will also need your User ID and Survey ID.

Please email csmapsupport@nyu.edu with the subject line "YouTube takeout" if you have any issues with these steps.
