- For frequency, choose "export once".
- For the file format field, select “.zip”.
- For file size, select 1 GB. 
*Note: if your file size is larger than 1 GB, you most likely selected more data than requested. Please make sure you unselect “videos” in step 4.*

## Step 2: Wait for your takeout data to become available
After completing these steps, it may take Google anywhere from 1 hour to a few days to send you the data archive.


## Step 3: Submit your takeout data to receive points
When the archive is ready, you will receive an email from “Google Takeout” with the subject “Your Google Data is ready to download.”

After you download your takeout data, you are ready to upload your data to the study <button><a href="https://www.csmapsurveys.org/youtube_takeout.html">upload form</a></button>.
You will also need your User ID and Survey ID.

Please email csmapsupport@nyu.edu with the subject line "YouTube takeout" if you have any issues with these steps.
